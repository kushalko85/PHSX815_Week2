# Third Homework
Generating categorical distribution and Rayleigh Distribution from the random numbers and plotting the distribution.

## 1) Generating Categorical distribution and Rayleigh distribution
The Python file `Random.py` has been updated with codes to generate the categorical distribution of rolling a dice (6 outcomes) and Rayleigh distribution.

## 2) making histogram plots of those two distributions
The Python file `homework_three.py` calls in the random numbers and the distribution functions from the `random.py` file. It then makes the histogram plots and saves them in the files `random.png` and `Dice.png`
