# Third Homework
Generating categorical distribution and Rayleigh Distribution from the random numbers and plotting the distribution.

## 1) Generating Categorical distribution and Rayleigh distribution
The Python file `Random.py` has been updated with codes to generate the categorical distribution of rolling a dice (6 outcomes) and Rayleigh distribution.

## 2) making histogram plots of those two distributions
The Python file `homework_three.py` calls in the random numbers and the distribution functions from the `random.py` file. It then makes the histogram plots and saves them in the files `Rayleigh.png` and `Dice.png` 


# Fourth Homework

## 1) Generating exponential distribution of cookie dissapereance
The Python file `CookieTimer.py` gives the `sample_output.txt` as a output. I chose rate = 2, Nmeas = 70 and Nexp = 10000 .

## 2) Making the histogram plot by reading the `sample_output.txt` file
The Python file `CookieAnalysis.py` generates two plots `timevspr.png` and `avgtimevspr.png`. The `avgtimes.png` has been labelled showing 1 sigma and 2 sigma positions.
